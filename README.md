Among the features of TalkFlow AI is that natural language understanding (NLU) is an essential part of it. It enables the system to understand user enquiries irrespective of how they phrase them. The use of NLU by TalkFlow AI helps it understand meaning from the texts, regardless of whether the users input statements, directions, or queries. The input is analysed to recognise the intent, entities, and emotions of the conversation; in this way, the system is capable of producing suitable responses for the flow of the conversation.
